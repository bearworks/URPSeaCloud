# URPSeaCloud

This is an optimized scene project for distance cloud rendering on URP. The sea&cloud of Demoscene1 can run up to 60FPS+ on the old graphics card HD 7730 (release time: June 25, 2013), and the cloud rendering time under 1080p is about 2ms. Demoscene1's sea&cloud can also run up to 30FPS on mobile devices(adreno 618).
